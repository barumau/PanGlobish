including French, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, Russian, Arabic, Hindi and Swahili.

Panglobish is compatible with English on a basic level.

to get a hotel room, to order a taxi, to buy souvenirs and to do many other things.

Panglobish is an excellent choice for the global second language because it improves the quality of international communication.

## The Basics of Panglobish

Panglobish is written in the English/Latin alphabet:  
A B C Ch D E F G H I J K L M N O P R S Sh T U V W X Y Z

Only one letter is pronounced different than what is normal in English:
**C** = ts as in _cats_.

All the vowels are pure vowels.
The letter **E** is pronounced as the central vowel /ə/ in unaccented syllables.

The spelling of Panglobish is nearly phonetic.
One sound = one letter.

The stressed syllable is the first one in short words and the second one in longer words.  
**méni pérson kán tóke da Énglish in Amérika.**
– Many people can speak English in America.

Words stay always the same in Panglobish.
There aren't any special _inflected_ forms for cases, tenses, moods, singular and plural etc.

The normal word order is subject–verb–object
so the doer comes first, then the action word and finally the object of the action.  
**mi love yu.**
– I love you.
