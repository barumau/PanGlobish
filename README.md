# Panglo language documentation

### Contents

This is a location for the base documentation about Panglo, a helping language
 for international communication that is designed to be simple, neutral and
evenly global.

#### Locations

This website is available online at https://www.pandunia.info/panglo

All plain text files are stored in a Git version control repository in GitHub
at https://github.com/barumau/PanGlobish

#### Multilingual documentation

The documentation is in many languages. The first language of the documentation
is currently English. (It may be changed to Panglo in the future.) All other
language versions are translated and adapted from the first language.

### Let's work together!

Panglo is meant to be a collaborative project. If you want, you can help in
many ways:

- Improve the documentation.
   - Edit text so that it's easier to understand. The documentation is aimed
     for common people with a basic education. If you don't understand
     something, the problem is probably the text, not you!
   - Correct mistakes when you spot them.
- Translate the documentation to new languages.
- Add more content!

The documentation is in plain-text that uses Markdown formatting. Learn about
Markdown [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

The easiest way to contribute for an average person is to download the files in
a zip file, edit them and [send them to Risto by email](mailto:risto@pandunia.info).
He will check the changes and upload the files to GitHub on your behalf.

If you have more time, you can learn how to use GitHub. Create an account for
yourself and follow instructions about [cloning a repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)
and [basic use](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). If you
contribute changes yourself, you will be added to our list of contributors
automatically.
