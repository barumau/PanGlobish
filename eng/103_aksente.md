# Accent

The accent or stress falls on the first or the second syllable depending on the length of the base word.

If the base word has one or two syllables, the first syllable is accented, and secondary accent falls on odd-numbered syllables.
Ex. kómun, kómunìte.

If the base word has three or more syllables, the second syllable is accented, and secondary accent falls on even-numbered syllables.
Ex. matúre, matúritè.

When there is **i** or **u** and another vowel, the two vowels count as one syllable.
Ex. páuze, dúnia, rádio, Rúsia, Arábia, Itália.

The elements of compound words keep their original accent.
Ex. télefóne, kílográme.

Accented syllables are louder in general.
If the accented syllable ends in a vowel, the vowel is pronounced longer.

Unaccented **e** can be pronounced as a weak schwa sound /ə/.
Ex. toke /tókə/, mature /matúrə/.


## Tone and Intonation

Word tone and sentence intonation don't have any grammatical function in Panglobish.

Panglobish is not a tonal language.
The pitch or melody of syllables in words doesn't affect the meaning of the word.

Also intonation i.e. the melody of a phrase, doesn't affect the meaning of the phrase.
For example it doesn't matter whether a questions is said in falling, rising or level intonation.

It is naturally possible to express emotions, like kindness and anger, with intonation
– but they are not grammatical functions of the language.
