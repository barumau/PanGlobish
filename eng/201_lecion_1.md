## Grammar

As you can see from the dialog, Panglobish is an easy language to learn.
It's easy to begin learning it if you already speak English.
(And you do, because you are reading this in English.)
But it's still easy even if you don't speak any English
because Panglobish is totally regular.

### Personal pronouns

Here are the personal pronouns in Panglobish:

| Singular                   | Plural                     |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **mi** – _I_               | **wi** – _we_              |
| **tu** – _you_             | **yu** – _you all_         |
| **he** – _he or she_       | **de** – _they_            |

The personal pronouns, like all words in Panglobish, never change.
The same word form is used as the subject (i.e. the "doer") and as the object.
So there aren't separate word forms like "I" and "me" or "we" and "us".

**mi mite yu.**
– I meet you.  
**yu mite mi.**
– You meet me.  
**wi mite de.**
– We meet them.

### Possessive pronouns

The possessive pronouns (_my_, _your_, etc.) are created regularly by adding the possessive marker **'s**.

| Singular                   | Plural                     |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **mi's** – _my_            | **wi's** – _our_           |
| **tu's** – _your_          | **yu's** – _your_          |
| **he's** – _his or her_    | **de's** – _their_         |

### The same verb in all persons

The verb for being is also regular and it's the same for all persons.

**mi is**
– I am  
**tu is**
– you are (thou art)  
**he is**
– he or she is  
**wi is**
– we are  
**yu is**
– you are  
**de is**
– they are

So verbs don't change to indicate the person.
And nouns don't change either!
The word **name**, in the same single form, can refer to one name or many names.

**he's name is Mari.**
– Her name is Mari.  
**he's name is Yusef.**
– His name is Yusef.  
**de's name is Mari en Yusef.**
– Their names are Mari and Yusef.

Panglobish is free from all sorts of inflection, declination, conjugation or whatever it's called.
Words don't change, period.
It's as simple as that!
