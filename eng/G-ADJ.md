# Modifiers

A modifier is a word that adds a particular quality or description,
such as good, bad, big, and fast, to another word.
In Panglo, there is only one class of modifiers.
The same word can modify nouns and verbs,
whereas in English only _adjectives_ can modify nouns
and only _adverbs_ can modify verbs.
For example, the word
**bele**
('beautiful' or 'beautifully')
modifies a noun in sentence A
and a verb in sentence B.

A. **da der es un _bele_ kitab.**
– That is a beautiful writing.  
B. **tu _bele_ li kitab.**
– You write _beautifully_.


## Modifying nouns

In Panglo, "adjectives" are modifiers that are placed before the noun that they modify.

**da nuve haus**
– the new house  
**da bele haus**
– the beautiful house  
**da nuve bele haus**
– the new beautiful house


## Comparison

Equality is expressed with the word
**az**
(as, like).

**da az nuve haus**
– the equally new house

Comparatives are made using the words
**mor**
(more) and
**les**
(less).

**un mor nuve haus**
– a newer house  
**un les nuve haus**
– a less new house

Superlatives are made using the words
**maxim**
(maximally, the most) and
**minim**
(minimally, the least).

**da maxim nuve haus**
– the newest house  
**da minim bele haus**
– the least beautiful house

The point of comparison is introduced with
**az**
('than').

**yu's haus is mor nuve az de's haus.**
– Your house is newer than their house.  
**de's haus is les nuve az yu's haus.**
– Their house is less new than your house.

Equality is introduced with
**sim**
('same, equally').

**vi's haus is sim nuve az yu's haus.**
– Our house is as new as your house.
