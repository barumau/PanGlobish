# Numerals

The basic numbers sound almost the same in Panglo as in English.
However, greater numbers are arranged more logically in Panglo.

| Ones    | Ten and over | 20 and over      | 30 and over      |
|:--------|:-------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|
| 0 zero  | 10 (un) ten  | 20 due ten       | 30 tri ten       |
| 1 un    | 11 ten un    | 21 due ten un    | 31 tri ten un    |
| 2 due   | 12 ten due   | 22 due ten due   | 32 tri ten due   |
| 3 tri   | 13 ten tri   | 23 due ten tri   | 33 tri ten tri   |
| 4 for   | 14 ten for   | 24 due ten for   | 34 tri ten for   |
| 5 faif  | 15 ten faif  | 25 du ten faif   | 35 tri ten faif  |
| 6 sixe  | 16 ten sixe  | 26 due ten sixe  | 36 tri ten sixe  |
| 7 seven | 17 ten seven | 27 due ten seven | 37 tri ten seven |
| 8 eite  | 18 ten eite  | 28 due ten eite  | 38 tri ten eite  |
| 9 nain  | 19 ten nain  | 29 due ten nain  | 39 tri ten nain  |

| Ones    |  Tens         | Hundreds        | Thousands        |
|:--------|:-------------|:----------------|:------------------|
| 0 zero  |              |                 |                   |
| 1 un    | 10 (un) ten  | 100 un hunde    | 1000 un tauzen    |
| 2 due   | 20 due ten   | 200 due hunde   | 2000 due tauzen   |
| 3 tri   | 30 tri ten   | 300 tri hunde   | 3000 tri tauzen   |
| 4 for   | 40 for ten   | 400 for hunde   | 4000 for tauzen   |
| 5 faif  | 50 faif ten  | 500 faif hunde  | 5000 faif tauzen  |
| 6 sixe  | 60 sixe ten  | 600 sixe hunde  | 6000 sixe tauzen  |
| 7 seven | 70 seven ten | 700 seven hunde | 7000 seven tauzen |
| 8 eite  | 80 eite ten  | 800 eite hunde  | 8000 eite tauzen  |
| 9 nain  | 90 nain ten  | 900 nain hunde  | 9000 nain tauzen  |

Greater numbers follow the same logic.

10'000 un ten tauzen  
100'000 un hunde tauzen  
1'000'000 un milion  
10'000'000 un ten milion  
100'000'000 un hunde milion  
1'000'000'000 un tauzen milion  

Note: The words "billion" and "milliard" are not used in Panglo
because their meanings are different from country to country.
Instead, one should say **tauzen milion** (thousand millions) or **giga**.

The prefixes of the [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units)
(SI) are used in common language in Panglo.
It is normal to say, for example:  
**eite giga person bi live in Dunia.**  
– Eight billion (or _milliard_) people live on Earth.

| Prefix   | Symbol  | Base 10 | Decimal                           |
|:---------|:-------:|:--------|----------------------------------:|
| deka     | da      | 10¹     |                                10 |
| heto     | h       | 10²     |                               100 |
| kilo     | k       | 10³     |                             1'000 |
| mega     | M       | 10⁶     |                         1'000'000 |
| giga     | G       | 10⁹     |                     1'000'000'000 |
| tera     | T       | 10¹²    |                 1'000'000'000'000 |
| peta     | P       | 10¹⁵    |             1'000'000'000'000'000 |
| exa      | E       | 10¹⁸    |         1'000'000'000'000'000'000 |
| zeta     | Z       | 10²¹    |     1'000'000'000'000'000'000'000 |
| yota     | Y       | 10²⁴    | 1'000'000'000'000'000'000'000'000 |


### Cardinal number before noun

Quantity can be expressed with numerals and other quantity-words.
They are put before the word or phrase that they qualify.

**un star**
– one star  
**du star**
– two stars  
**tri star**
– three stars  
**kam star**
– few stars  
**meni star**
– many stars

**un dai kursi**
– one big chair  
**du dai kursi**
– two big chairs  
**tri dai kursi**
– three big chairs


## Ordinal numbers

Ordinal numbers are similar to cardinal numbers
but they are placed after the noun that they modify.

**parte un**
– part one (the first part)  
**parte du**
– part two (the second part)  
**parte tri**
– part three (the third part)


## Classifiers of measurement

The classifier of measurement or a measure word is a word that occurs between a numeral and a noun.
It indicates how the referent of the noun is measured, contained or packaged.
Classifiers of measurement is an open class of words,
which includes, among many others,
**litre**
'liter',
**mitre**
'meter',
**botle**
'bottle',
**kupa**
'cup, mug',
**pake**
'package',
**pote**
'pot',
**sake**
'bag, sack',
**tin**
'can, tin'
**tong**
'cask, barrel'.

Measure words are used in this simple structure:
number + measure word + **se** + noun.

**du litre se jus**
– two liters of juice  
**tri metre se kable**
– three meters of wire  
**un kupa se kafe**
– a cup of cofee  
**du botle se vin**
– two bottles of wine  
**tri sake se patato**
– three sacks of potatoes  
**for tin se limon jus**
– four cans of lemonade


## Fractions

Fractions are formed with the help of the word
**parte**
'part'.

Fractions can be interpreted in two ways.
Firstly, the word
**parte**
can be interpreted as a classifier of measurement.
Then, for example,
**du parte tri**
is interpreted as 'two parts of three (parts)'.
Secondly, the last numeral can be understood as an ordinal number that modifies
**parte**.
Then, for example,
**du parte tri**
is interpreted as 'two thirds'.
Both interpretations lead to the same result that
**du parte tri**
stands for '2/3' in mathematical symbols.

**un parte du**
– a half (½)  
**un parte for**
– one fourth, one quarter (¼)  
**tri parte for**
– three fourths, three quarters (¾)  
**un parte hunde**
– one hundredth, one percent (1%)  
**un parte tauzen**
– one thousandth, one permille (1‰)

Fractions are connected to their noun head with
**se**.

**un parte du se haur**
– a half (of an) hour  
**faif ten parte hunde se jen**
– fifty percent of people  
**du parte tri se keke**
– two thirds of a cake  


In addition, there is also a longer pattern for forming fractions.
It uses the pattern
**X of Y parte**
('X of Y parts').

**un of du parte**
– one of two parts, a half (½)  
**un of for parte**
– one of four parts, a quarter (¼)  
**tri of for parte**
– three of four parts, three quarters (¾)  
**un of hunde parte**
– one of hundred parts, a percent (1%)  
**un of tauzen parte**
– one of thousand parts, a permille (1‰)

## Months

The names of the months are:

1. **Januari**
   – January
2. **Februari**
   – February
3. **Marte**
   – March
4. **April**
   – April
5. **Mai**
   – May
6. **June**
   – June
7. **Yuli**
   – July
8. **Auguste**
   – August
9. **Setembre**
   – September
10. **Otobre**
   – October
11. **Novembre**
   – November
12. **Desembre**
   – December

In addition there is **Ramazan** (Ramadan), the holy ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar.

Alternatively there is also a number-based system of naming.

1. **mes un**
   – January
2. **mes due**
   – February
3. **mes tri**
   – March
4. **mes for**
  – April
5. **mes faif**
  – May
6. **mes sixe**
  – June
7. **mes seven**
  – July
8. **mes eite**
  – August
9. **mes nain**
  – September
10. **mes ten**
  – October
11. **mes ten un**
  – November
12. **mes ten du**
  – December


## Days of the week

In ancient Greece, the days of the week were named after the _Seven Luminaries_,
which consist of the Sun, Moon and the five planets that are visible to the naked eye.
Each of the luminaries was also represented by a deity.
This system spread to Rome, India, China and almost all across the world.

In English, the Roman deities were substituted by Germanic deities:
Sunday = sun's day, Monday = moon's day, Tuesday = Tiw's day, Wednesday = Woden's day, Thursday = Thor's day, and Saturday = Saturn's day.

In Panglo, the names of the days of the week follow the Roman system,
whereas the English system involved Germanic deities.

| Luminary    | Day of the week         |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Sole**    | **soledi**              |
| Sun         | Sunday                  |
| **Lune**    | **lunedi**              |
| moon        | Monday (moon's day)     |
| **Marte**   | **martedi**             |
| Mars        | Tuesday (Tiw's day)     |
| **Merkur**  | **merkurdi**            |
| Mercury     | Wednesday (Woden's day) |
| **Jove**    | **jovedi**              |
| Jupiter     | Thursday (Thor's day)   |
| **Venera**  | **venerdi**             |
| Venus       | Friday (Frige's day)    |
| **Saturne** | **saturdi**             |
| Saturn      | Saturday (Saturn's day) |


Alternatively there is also a number-based system of naming.

1. **vike dey un**
– Monday (the 1st day of the week)
2. **vike dey due**
– Tuesday (the 2nd  day of the week)
3. **vike dey tri**
– Wednesday (the 3rd day of the week)
4. **vike dey for**
– Thursday (the 4th  day of the week)
5. **vike dey faive**
– Friday (the 5th day of the week)
6. **vike dey sixe**
– Saturday (the 6th  day of the week)
7. **vike dey seven**
– Sunday (the 7th  day of the week)

However, this is an unreliable system
because the first day of the week can be different in different countries.
In addition it is important to differentiate the days of the week
(**vike dey**)
and the days of the month
(**mes dey**).

## Time

The normal pattern for telling time is
**haur H e M**,
where H stands for hours and M stands for minutes.
We always use this direct pattern,
and we never use words like *past* and *to* in Panglo.

**haur tri**
– three o'clock  
**haur tri e siro**
– three o'clock sharp  
**haur tri e faif**
– three oh-five – or five past three  
**haur tri e ten**
– three ten – or ten past three  
**haur tri e ten faif**
– three fifteen – or quarter past three  
**haur tri e tri ten**
– three thirty – or half past three  
**haur tri e for ten faif**
– three forty-five – or quarter to four  
**haur tri e faif ten**
– three fifty – or ten to four  
**haur tri e faif ten faif**
– three-fifty-five – or five to four


#### The 24 hour clock

Normally we use the 24 hour clock to tell the time in Panglo.

01:00 =
**haur un**
– one o'clock ~ one hundred hours  
01:15 =
**haur un e ten faif**
– one fifteen ~ one hundred fifteen hours  
01:30 =
**haur un e tri ten**
– one thirty ~ one hundred thirty hours  
13:00 =
**haur ten tri**
– thirteen o'clock ~ thirteen hundred hours  
13:15 =
**haur ten tri e ten faif**
– thirteen fifteen ~ thirteen hundred fifteen hours  
13:30 =
**haur ten tri e tri ten**
– thirteen thirty ~ thirteen hundred thirty hours

#### The 12 hour clock

The 12 hour clock splits the day into two 12 hour sections.
One lasts from midnight to noon and the second half lasts from noon to midnight.
Hours before noon are called *AM* (pronounced *ah-em*),
which comes from the phrase
**ante mide den**,
which means 'before midday'.
Hours after noon are called *PM* (pronounced *peh-em*), which comes from the phrase
**pos mide den**,
which means 'after midday'.

Before midday we say:

<big>🕐</big> =
**haur un AM**
– one AM  
<big>🕜</big> =
**haur un e tri ten AM**
– one thirty AM  
<big>🕔</big> =
**haur faif AM**
– five AM  
<big>🕙</big> =
**haur ten AM**
– ten AM

After midday we say:

<big>🕐</big> =
**haur un PM**
– one PM  
<big>🕜</big> =
**haur un e tri ten PM**
– one thirty PM
<big>🕔</big> =
**haur faif PM**
– five PM  
<big>🕙</big> =
**haur ten PM**
– ten PM
