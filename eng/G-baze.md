# The 10 Rules of Panglo

Panglo is so simple that its basic grammar can be described in only ten rules,
all of which can fit on a sheet of paper.
There are no exceptions.

### (1) World words

Panglo is an evenly global language.
International words are borrowed from all parts of the world to Panglo.
They are adapted to the pronunciation and orthography of Panglo.
One basic word is admitted and additional words are built from it according to rule 10.


### (2) Spelling and pronunciation

Spelling is simple and regular.
Every word is pronounced exactly as it is written.
Almost every letter and letter-combination indicates always the same sound.


### (3) Regular stress accent

Root words are stressed on the syllable that is before the last consonant of the word, f.ex.
**háu** ('nice'), **dúnia** ('world'), **básh** ('language'), **amén** ('amen').
Derived words and compound words are stressed according to their components so that the main component carries the primary stress
and other components may carry secondary stress, f.ex.
**trabásh** ('translate'), **dúnialìsme** ('globalism'), **bàsh skóla** ('language school').
Primary accent is indicated here by an acute accent (*á*) and secondary accent by a grave accent (*à*).


### (4) Pronouns

The personal pronouns are:  
**mi**
'I',
**tu**
'you' (singular),
**hi**
'he, she, it',
**vi**
'we',
**yu**
'you' (plural),
**de**
'they'.

The possessive pronouns are:  
**mi's**
'my',
**tu's**
'your',
**hi's**
'his or her',
**vi's**
'our',
**yu's**
'your',
**de's**
'their'.

The interrogative pronouns are:
**vat**
'what',
**hu**
'who',
**hu's**
'whose'.


### (5) Nouns

Nouns have only one form, always the same.
Their form is not affected by number, gender or case.
Number is indicated by number and quantity words.
Their role is indicated by word order or by a preposition.

### (6) Numerals

The cardinal numbers are:  
0 **siro**, 1 **un**, 2 **du**, 3 **tri**, 4 **for**, 5 **faif**, 6 **sixe**,
7 **seven**, 8 **eit**, 9 **nain**, 10 **ten**.  
Greater than ten:
11 **ten un**, 12 **ten du**, 13 **ten tri**,
etc.  
Tens:
20 **du ten**, 30 **tri ten**, 40 **for ten**,
etc.  
Hundreds:
100 **un hunde**, 200 **du hunde**, 300 **tri hunde**,
etc.  
Thousands:
1000 **un tauzen**, 2000 **du tauzen**, 3000 **tri tauzen**,
etc.

When a number is put after the noun, it becomes the corresponding ordinal number:  
**parte un**
– part one, the first part  
**parte du**
– part two, the second part  
**parte tri**
– part three, the third part


### (7) Modifiers

The adjective and the adverb have the same form.
The adjective modifier is before the noun that it modifies,
and the adverb modifier is before the verb that it modifies.

**un rapid logu**
– A fast speech.  
**tu rapid logu.**
– You speak fast.


### (8) Verbs

The verb does not change in person, number and tense.
Auxiliary verbs indicate time.

- **bi**
  indicates an ongoing event.
- **hav**
  indicates a completed event, which has an effect on the present situation.
- **did**
  indicates a past event.
- **vil**
  indicates a future event.


### (9) Word order

The word order is subject–verb–object.
The same order is used in declarations and questions.

A passive sentence is created with the help of the passive auxiliary verb
**ben**.
A similar effect can also be reached with the impersonal pronoun
**von**.

**Panglo ben logu.**
– Panglo is spoken.  
**von logu Panglo.**
– One speaks Panglo.

In the _pivot structure_, the object of the transitive verb functions as the subject of the following verb.  
**mi ples tu logu Panglo.**
– I ask you to speak Panglo.

Pronouns can be left out when they are obvious and redundant.  
**_mi_ ples _tu_ logu Panglo.**
→ **ples logu Panglo.**  
– Please speak Panglo.


### (10) Word building

In Panglo, words change only when their actual meaning changes.
Words don't ever change only to serve in a different grammatical role.
Compound words are made by combining the elements that form them.
The main word stands at the end.

**poste**
('mail') +
**kase**
('box') =
**poste kase**
('mailbox')
