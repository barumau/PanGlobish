to get a hotel room, to order a taxi, to buy souvenirs and to do many other things.

## Learn it now!

Panglo is written in the Latin (and English!) alphabet:  
A B C Ch D E F G H I J K L M N O P R S Sh T U V X Y Z

Only one letter is pronounced different than what is normal in English:
**c** = ts as in _cats_.
However, this letter is used rarely alone.
It is normally part of the digraph **ch**, which is pronounced as in the English word *church*.

All vowels are pure vowels.
They are pronounced as in
<i><u>a</u>re th<u>e</u>re thr<u>ee</u> <u>o</u>r tw<u>o</u></i>.

The spelling of Panglo is nearly phonetic.
One sound = one letter.

The stress is on that syllable that is before the last consonant of the root word.
Prefixes and suffixes are either unstressed or they may carry a secondary stress.  
**méni hóm kán básh Englísh in Amérika.**
– Many people can speak English in America.

Words stay always the same in Panglo.
There aren't any special _inflected_ forms for cases, tenses, moods, singular and plural etc.

The normal word order is subject–verb–object
so the doer comes first, then the action word and finally the object of the action.  
**mi love yu.**
– I love you.

**yu love hu?**
– Who do you love?  
**yu love mi, he?**
