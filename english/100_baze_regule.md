# The 10 Rules of Dunish

Dunish is so simple that its basic grammar can be described in only ten rules,
all of which can fit on a sheet of paper.
There are no exceptions.

1. **World Words:**
   Dunish is an evenly global language.
   International words are borrowed from all parts of the world to Dunish.
   They are adapted to the Dunish pronunciation and orthography.
   One base word is admitted and additional words are built from it according to rule 10.
2. **Spelling and pronunciation:**
   Spelling is simple and regular.
   Each word is pronounced exactly as it is written.
   Almost every letter and letter-combination denotes always the same sound.
3. **Regular Accent:**
   If the word has one or two syllables, the first syllable is accented.
   If the word has three or more syllables, the second syllable is accented.
4. **Nouns:**
   Words don’t ever change.
5. **Numerals:**
   The cardinal numbers are:
       - 0 **zero**, 1 **un**, 2 **due**, 3 **tri**, 4 **for**, 5 **faive**, 6 **sikse**,
         7 **seven**, 8 **eite**, 9 **nain**, 10 **ten**.
       - Greater than ten: 11 **ten un**, 12 **ten due**, 13 **ten tri**, etc.
       - Tens: 20 **due ten**, 30 **tri ten**, 40 **for ten**, etc.
       - Hundreds: 100 **un hunde**, 200 **due hunde**, 300 **tri hunde**, etc.
       - Thousands: 1000 **un tauzen**, 2000 **due tauzen**, 3000 **tri tauzen**, etc.
       - The cardinal numbers, when placed after a noun, become ordinal numbers.
6. **Adjectives:**
   The adjective is always placed before the noun with the exception of the ordinal numbers.
    - The comparative of equality is **as...as** (as...as).
    - The comparative of superiority is **mor...dan** (more...than).
    - The comparative of inferiority is **les...dan** (less...than).
7. **Pronouns:**
    - The personal pronouns are:
     **mi** _I_, **tu** _you_ (sg.), **he** _he or she_,
     **wi** _we_, **yu** _you_ (pl.), **de** _they_.
    - The possessive pronouns are:
      **mi's** _my_, **tu's** _your_, **he's** _his or her_,
      **wi's** _our_, **yu's** _your_, **de's** _their_.
     - The interrogative pronouns are: **wa** _what_, **hu** _who_, **hu's** _whose_.
8. **Verbs:**
   The verb does not change in person, number and tense.
    - **is** indicates an ongoing event.
    - **has** indicates a completed event whose results have an effect on the present situation.
    - **was** indicates a completed event that has no connection to the present situation.
    - **wil** indicates a future event.
9. **Word order:**
   The word order is subject – verb – object, in declarations and questions alike.
10. **Word building:**
   In Dunish, words change only when their actual meaning changes.
   Words don't ever change only to serve in a different grammatical role.
