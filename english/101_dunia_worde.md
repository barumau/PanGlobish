## Let's meet halfway!

Dunish is an evenly global language.
It's not "English only" and it's not Europe-centric either,
because that would not be global.

We live in a world that has many languages and many cultures.
The international language shall be able to serve as a bridge between all of them.

National languages like English and Chinese are not so good international languages because they are one-sided.
For example, if an American wants to speak with a Chinese person,
the American has to learn Chinese language and culture
or the Chinese has to learn English language and American culture.
So they can only meet at one or the other end of the bridge.

Dunish helps people to meet halfway.
And it's easy!
Going back to the previous example,
the American has to learn to speak Dunish
but it's easy because Dunish has so much common with the English language.
Also the Chinese has to learn Dunish
but it's easy for them too because Dunish has so much common with Chinese too!


## Re-using English words

"But people already know English!"

It's true that a lot of people have learned English.
It is the most learned second or foreign language in the world today.
English is taught in schools in China, India, Japan, Russia, Germany, Mexico, etc.
Unfortunately nothing guarantees that all learners would speak English very well.
In fact, the level of English speaking skills varies from person to person and from country to country.
At one end there are people who speak it almost like natives.
At the other end there are people who can grunt only a few words with a thick accent.

Dunish borrows basic words from English because "everyone knows them already".
There are less and less English words on higher levels,
because most people don't know them
and because many advanced words are specific to a certain culture
so a local word is most appropriate anyway.

| Level          | English-like words |
|:---------------|:------------------:|
| Beginner       |        95%         |
| Elementary     |        80%         |
| Intermediate   |        60%         |
| Advanced       |        40%         |

English words are only the tip of the iceberg in Dunish.
Dunish is much more diverse than what one might see at first sight.
