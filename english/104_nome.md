# Nouns

A noun is a word that functions as the name of some specific thing or set of things,
such as living creatures, objects, places, actions, qualities, states of existence, or ideas.

Nouns are unchanging in Panglobish.
The same form of the word is used regardless of number and definiteness.
Number, definiteness and other categories are expressed by separate words.


## Number

In Panglobish, nouns are the same in all numbers.
Nouns don't change to indicate is there one (i.e. singular) or many (i.e. plural)
instances of the thing that the noun refers to.
So it's not like English where the singular and the plural of nouns are usually different:
one _man_ but many _men_, one _ox_ but many _oxen_, one _cat_ but many _cats_.
Rather, all Panglobish words are like the word "sheep" is in English,
which you count one sheep, two sheep, three sheep, etc.

In Panglobish, the number of things is indicated with number words and other quantity words.

**un haus**
– one house  
**due haus**
– two houses  
**tri haus**
– three houses  
**for haus**
– four houses

All number words can be found in the [chapter about numerals](105_numbe.md).

Common words for indicating plurality include **som** (_some_) and **meni** (_many_).

**som haus**
– some houses  
**meni haus**
– many houses

## Definite and indefinite articles

Definite articles, like "the" in English, are used
when we are referring to a specific thing or something that has been mentioned before.
Indefinite articles, like "a" and "an" in English,
refer to a non-specific thing or something that has not been mentioned before.

If you know what you want, you just use a definite article,
and if you don’t know what you want, you use an indefinite article.

### Indefinite articles

There are two indefinite articles in Panglobish,
**un** is used when we refer to _one_ non-specific thing,
and **som** is used when we refer to _many_ things.

**un apel**
– an apple _or_ one apple  
**som apel**
– some apples

**un haus**
– a house _or_ one house  
**som haus**
– some houses


### Definite articles

There are two definite articles in Panglobish,
**da** is used when we refer to _one_ specific thing,
and **di** is used when we refer to _many_ things.

**da man**
– the man  
**di man**
– the men

**da haus**
– the house  
**di haus**
– the houses


## Proper names

### Adaptation to Panglobish

Proper names are typically adapted to the writing system of Panglobish.
For example, it is obviously better to use
**Moskva** (Moscow) instead of "Москва",
and **Beijing** (Peking) instead of "北京"
in the international language.
Likewise it is probably better to use
**Tuson** instead of "Tucson",
**Marsei** instead of "Marseille", and
**Kishineu** instead of "Chișinău"
in order to ensure correct pronunciation.


### Titles of respect

Names of people can be tagged with titles of respect
**sa**, **ma**, **pa**.
They are meant to show respect and politeness.

**sa**
is the universal title of respect.
It can be used in formal and informal situations and for all age groups, social groups and genders.
The closest translation for it in English is _Mr or Ms_ or _Mx_.

**ma**
can be used when addressing any woman
regardless of age, social status, and marital status.
It translates to several titles in English including _Mrs_, _Miss_, _Ms_, _Madam_ and _Ma'am_.

**pa**
can be used when addressing any man
regardless of age, social status, and marital status.
It translates to several titles in English including _Mister_ and _Sir_.

There are different customs concerning honorific titles in different cultures.
In some cultures it is not polite to use someone's name without using a title of respect before it.
Therefore it is advisable to use them always when you meet new people from different cultures.

A title of respect can be used with a given name, a family name, or both.

**sa Bili King**
– Mx Billy King  
**sa Bili**
– Mx Billy  
**sa King**
– Mx King

It is always polite to use the gender-neutral title.
However, some people have are more accustomed to using the male and female titles.

**pa Felipe Gonzales**
– Mr Felipe Gonzales  
**pa Felipe**
– Mr Felipe  
**pa Gonzales**
– Mr Gonzales

The order of the given name and the family name may be different in different cultures.
For example in Chinese it is common to put the family name first.

**ma Wang Lili**
– Ms Lili Wang  
**ma Lili**
– Ms Lili  
**ma Wang**
– Ms Wang
