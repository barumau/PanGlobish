## Personal pronouns

The personal pronouns in Dunish are:

| Person | Singular             | Plural             |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------|
| 1st    | **mi** (_I_)         | **wi** (_we_)      |
| 2nd    | **tu** (_you_)       | **yu** (_you all_) |
| 3rd    | **he** (_he or she_) | **de** (_they_)    |

All personal pronouns are gender-neutral in Dunish.
We don't differentiate the sexes in any of them.
So the third person singular pronoun **he** means both _him_ and _her_ (or _he_ and _she_).

The singular pronoun **tu** can be used in all situations, both formal and informal,
regardless of the differences of social status and age of the speakers.
In this way it is similar to Swedish _du_.
However, some speakers may prefer to use **tu** only with family and intimate friends.
Then its usage is comparable to German _du_, French _tu_, Russian _ты_ (ty) and Hindi तू (tū).

It is always acceptable to use the plural pronoun **yu**
instead of the singular pronoun **tu**.


## Possessive pronouns

Possessive pronouns are made simply by combining a basic pronoun
with the possessive marker **'s**.

| Person | Singular                | Plural               |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| 1st    | **mi's** (_my_)         | **wi's** (_our_)     |
| 2nd    | **tu's** (_your_)       | **yu's** (_your_)    |
| 3rd    | **he's** (_his or her_) | **de's** (_their_)   |
