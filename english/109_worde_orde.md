## Prepositions

A prepositions begins a preposition phrase that tells additional information about the event that the sentence is about.
There are a handful of real prepositions in Panglobish, as listed below,
and the others are verbs that can function in the same way as prepositions.

**a**
– at  
**in**
– in  
**of**
– of, from, since  
**to**
– to, toward, until  
**on**
– on, about  
**be**
– by, with, by means of

**mi live in London.**
– I live in London.  
**mi safar of London to Paris be bus.**
– I travel from London to Paris by bus.  
**mi tinke on yu.**
– I think about you.

When a verb plays the role of a preposition, it is always followed by an article (or another determiner) and the object.

**mi's haus is _bake da_ parke.**
– My house is behind the park.  
**da bazar is _inter da_ hotel en da plasa.**
– The market is between the hotel and the square.

Note that if there's no article between the "preposition" and another word,
there is a compound word instead.

**da rute inter di kontinente**
– the route between the continents  
**da interkontinental rute**
– the intercontinental route

Common preposition-like words:  
**bake**
– at the back, behind

**face**
– facing, toward  
**grace**

## Modal particles

[Modal particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_particle)
indicate how the speaker thinks that the content of the sentence relates to the participants' common knowledge
or add mood to the meaning of the sentence.


The word **wa** is used to turn a declarative sentence into a question.

**yu wan yam som piza.**
– You want to eat some pizza.  
**yu wan yam som piza, wa?**
– Do you want to eat some pizza?

Another way to tag a question is to add the word **no** at the end of a sentence.
The **no** can represent any English question tag, so depending on context it will translate as:
"isn't it?", "aren't they?", "can't she?", "wouldn't they?", etc.

**yu wan yam som piza, no?**
– You want to eat pizza, don't you?

**ye**
indicates that the speaker thinks a certain fact should already be known to the listener.

**mi love yu, ye!**
– I do love you!

The word **or** indicates uncertainty.
It is used when the speaker wants to be reassured.

**yu love mi, or...**
– You love me, or...
