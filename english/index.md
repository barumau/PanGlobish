Hello world!
Welcome to learn about Panglobish, the helping language for international business and friendship.

## What is Panglobish?

Panglobish is a simple language that helps people to talk with each other
when they don't have any other language in common.

All words in Panglobish are international.
The basic words are similar to English
and the rest come from other important languages,
including French, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, Russian, Arabic, Hindi and Swahili.

Panglobish is compatible with English on a basic level.
It's like a simplified version of English that is spoken with a foreign accent.
So you can use Panglobish already now everywhere in the world where English is understood
to get a hotel room, to order a taxi, to buy souvenirs and to do many other things.

Panglobish is regular and simple.
Therefore it can be learned much easier and faster than English and other national languages.
There aren't any exceptions or complex grammatical rules in Panglobish.
Panglobish is so simple that its basic grammar can be described in [only ten rules](100_baze_regule.md).
Everybody can learn Panglobish to a good level in a short period of time!
Panglobish is an excellent choice for the global second language because it improves the quality of international communication.
It's better to speak good Panglobish than bad English.

The Panglobish grammar is [here in one web page](pan.md) and [here in one PDF file](pan.pdf).

## The Basics of Panglobish

Panglobish is written in the English/Latin alphabet:  
A B C Ch D E F G H I J K L M N O P R S Sh T U V W X Y Z

Only one letter is pronounced different than what is normal in English:
**C** = ts as in _cats_.

All the vowels are pure vowels.
The letter **E** is pronounced as the central vowel /ə/ in unaccented syllables.

The spelling of Panglobish is nearly phonetic.
One sound = one letter.

The stressed syllable is the first one in short words and the second one in longer words.  
**méni pérson kán tóke da Énglish in Amérika.**
– Many people can speak English in America.

Words stay always the same in Panglobish.
There aren't any special _inflected_ forms for cases, tenses, moods, singular and plural etc.

The normal word order is subject–verb–object
so the doer comes first, then the action word and finally the object of the action.  
**mi love yu.**
– I love you.

A sentence-final particle expresses why the sentence is said,
